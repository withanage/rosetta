 * @property string $subdirectory The subdirectory of the load directory where the deposit activity is located.
 * @property string $id The unique identifier for the deposit activity.
 * @property string $creation_date The date and time when the deposit activity was created.
 * @property string $submission_date The date and time when the deposit activity was submitted.
 * @property string $update_date The date and time when the deposit activity was last updated.
 * @property string $status The status of the deposit activity, which can be one of the following: inprocess, rejected, draft, approved, declined, error, finished.
 * @property string $title The title associated with the deposit activity.
 * @property array $producer_agent An associative array containing information about the producer agent of the depositor, with 'value' and 'desc' properties.
 * @property array $producer An associative array containing information about the producer of the deposit, with 'value' and 'desc' properties.
 * @property array $material_flow An associative array containing information about the Material Flow used, with 'value' and 'desc' properties.
 * @property string $sip_id The SIP (Submission Information Package) ID assigned to the deposit activity.
 * @property string $sip_reason The reason for which the SIP was rejected or declined, if applicable.
 *
 * @note This class is typically used in conjunction with Rosetta import and export operations to manage and represent deposit activity data.
